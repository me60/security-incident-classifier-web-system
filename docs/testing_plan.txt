GUIDE: 

Tests will be documented with a code in form x+_y+_z+ where:

x = effect groups interacting with y as o = onepick or m = multipick

y = intermediate type as b = binary, c = counter, i = increment, or cb = codeblock

z = severity group as e = exclusive or r = regressive

+ indicates one or more, i.e. you can have multiple different intermediates, effect groups, or severity groups

Test o_b_e: Binary Intermediate Base 
Test o_c_e: Counter Intermediate Base 
Test o_i_e: Increment Intermediate Base 
Test m_b_e: Multipick instead of Onepick against Binary Intermediate 
Test m_c_e: Multipick instead of Onepick against Counter Intermediate 
Test m_i_e: Multipick instead of Onepick against Increment Intermediate 
Test o_o_b_e: Multiple Effect Groups against Binary Intermediate
Test o_o_c_e: Multiple Effect Groups against Counter Intermediate
Test o_o_i_e: Multiple Effect Groups against Increment Intermediate
Test o_m_b_e: Mixed Effect Groups against Binary Intermediate
Test o_m_c_e: Mixed Effect Groups against Counter Intermediate
Test o_m_i_e: Mixed Effect Groups against Increment Intermediate
Test o_o_o_m_i_b_c_e_e_e: Ant Infestation Classifier
